        Time planning is a process in which the importance of activities and their interaction with goals are assessed. Priority is given to the most significant and goal-oriented tasks. Scheduling is making every minute more efficient!

A study by the University of Delhi reveals that a person’s focus on something other than what they should focus on according to their own and the company’s priorities is procrastination. On the other hand, if an individual postpones a less important task in favor of a more important task, it cannot be called procrastination. It is advanced time planning and prioritization. 

Improving time management skills helps develop and achieve better results in the work environment through a more effective strategy and fewer resources. Failure to meet deadlines and excessive stress are part of unsuccessful time planning. </div>

        <h2> We have compiled recommendations for developing time management skills: </h2>

        <ul>
            <li> <h3>Prioritize the most important and time-consuming tasks. </h3>
                <p> It is recommended to perform the most important tasks when you are at your best to focus and start them as soon as possible. It is better to perform less important tasks between meetings or appointments, thus allocating longer periods of time to more important tasks that require more intensive concentration.</p>
            </li>
            <li> <h3> Set deadlines and enjoy rest time.</h3>
                <p> You will feel better if you complete the tasks on time without unnecessary stress. A sense of satisfaction will motivate you to work more efficiently, and colleagues will appreciate that they can trust you. In the moments of rest, you will be able to not think about the unfinished tasks, and the holidays will seem more relaxing!</p>
            </li>

            <li> <h3> Do more in less time. </h3>
                <p>Knowing how to manage your time means that you can achieve more in less time with less effort. Think about how much more you do when you really focus. Use this time to do more and relax when your concentration starts to drop.
                </p> </li>
            <li> <h3> Achieve your goals faster.</h3>
                <p> Using time more efficiently will give you a sense of progress, and you will feel motivated to move towards your goal. We often feel fulfilled when we reach big goals. But even small goals are important. Developing time planning will give you extra time to move on to growth! </p>
            </li>
            <li> <h3>Build self-confidence.</h3>
                <p> Both in the work environment and outside, you will look and feel more confident if you will feel satisfied with what you have done and can make full use of your time!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> <h3>Forget about doing many tasks at once.</h3>
                <p> It is often heard that performing several tasks at the same time is considered a high-level skill. However, in reality, by pursuing such a work style, it is impossible to fully focus on the tasks to be performed and invest enough energy. A study by the American Psychological Association shows that our brain functions are not designed to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This only increases the chance of making mistakes.
