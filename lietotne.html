                <th> Todoist</th> 
                <th> has a free base version and upgraded plans. It features a reminder system linked to your to-do list, which can trigger reminds across all your devices even when you're using them offline. The platform focuses on organising and prioritising tasks and setting clear goals and deadlines for projects. It also supports measurement and reporting and allows you to delegate tasks to other users. The interface operates similarly to a Kanban board, which can help you navigate tasks easily across platforms.</th>

            <tr> 
                <th> Forest </th> 
                <th>Forest stands out from the rest of the online time tracking software on this list as it lets you plant virtual trees. The catch is that you can only grow a virtual tree while you’re not using your smartphone; if you leave the app, the tree dies.

The more time you spend away from your phone, the bigger your trees will grow. This is perfect for users who feel like they spend too much time on their phones or find it difficult to stay focused.

Forest’s best feature is how it lets you plant real-life trees once you’ve planted enough virtual trees. This app not only helps you develop stronger focus habits but also provides an opportunity to help preserve nature.</th>

                <th> Remember the Milk </th>
                <th>This to-do list app lets you set priorities, assign tags, and set due dates to stay on top of all your tasks. You can also create subtasks for bigger projects, search through tasks, and receive reminders through several channels like email and instant messaging platforms.</th>

                <th> Evernote </th>
                <th>While not traditionally thought of as a time management app, it’s one of the most versatile note-taking apps on the market. It lets you compile notes, create to-do lists, and manage tasks like a time tracking tool. It’s a useful app for remote business owners to keep track of both professional and personal responsibilities. </th>
